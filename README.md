This repository contains a PHP implementation of a simple digital menu for local businesses.
Run a local server with:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000/index.php](http://localhost:8000/index.php) in your browser to test.

To access the administration panel visit [http://localhost:8000/admin.php](http://localhost:8000/admin.php) and use **admin123** as password. From there you can change colors, menu items and other data stored in `config.json`.
